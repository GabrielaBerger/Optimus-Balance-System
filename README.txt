# Optimus Precision Balance & Drone-Assisted Locomotion

This repository presents a visionary balance and terrain-awareness system for humanoid robots like Tesla's Optimus. The concept integrates quaternion orientation, gyroscopic sensors, and drone-assisted spatial triangulation for real-time dynamic balance in complex environments.

## Features
- Quaternion orientation engine
- Drone-assisted environmental mapping
- Gyroscopic precision balancing
- Sensor fusion AI module

## Project Status
This is a conceptual and partially implemented system. Code modules are placeholders. Full system requires hardware validation.
